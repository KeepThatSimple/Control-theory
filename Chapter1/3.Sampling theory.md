Sampling Theory
==========

[Add image of sampling]

With:
* t the time
* Ts the sample period; 
* x(t) the system measure;
* x[k] the discrete measure

x[k] = x(k*Ts)

The ideal sampling is done by applying a comb of Dirac to the signal (a dirac impulse every kTs with k = 1 ... N).

Dirac[Ts](t) = sum(k=-inf, inf) { dirac(t-kTs) }

xsampled(t) = x(t) * Dirac[Ts](t)

xsampled(t) = sum(k=-inf, inf) { x(kTs) * dirac(t-kTs) }


Fourier transform of a sampled signal
-----------------------

Dirac[Ts](t) = sum(k=-inf, inf) { c_k * e^(j*k*w_s*t) }, w_s = 2Pi/Ts


c_k = 1/Ts * Int(-Ts/2, Ts/2) { Dirac[Ts](t)*e^(j*k*w_s*t * dt }

c_k = 1/Ts * sum(k=-inf, inf) { e^(j*k*w_s*t) }, w_s = 2Pi/Ts

With xs(t) = x(t)*Dirac[Ts](t):

Xs(w) = F[x(t)*Dirac[Ts](t)]

Xs(w) = 1/Ts * sum(k=-inf, inf) { F[x(t) * e^(j*k*w_s*t)] }, w_s = 2Pi/Ts

Xs(w) = 1/Ts *  sum(k=-inf, inf) { X(w - kw_s) }

**The Fourier transform of the sampled signal is a superposition of shifted analog spectra X(w-kw_s) multiplied by 1/Ts.

Implications
--------------

Meaning you have to be careful as you will see some high frequency components coming from the repetition of low frequency components and low frequency components that comes from high frequency aliasing.
