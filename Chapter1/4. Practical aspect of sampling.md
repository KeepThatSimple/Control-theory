Practical aspects of sampling
========================

Sampling measure a physical data in one moment of time in the **past**.

With:

* Acquisition time: Time to acquire the analog signal
* Settling time: Time to settle to the final value within the accuracy tolerance
* Aperture time: Time for the sampling to switch open
* Aperture jitter: Variation of timings in between measurements (due to the clock)

The result has a staircase shape.

The quantification is the second step of the digitalisation:

* Allows the storage of the signal value
* Each "stair" of the sampling will be rounded to the closest represantable data.
