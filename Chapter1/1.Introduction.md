Introduction
=============

While the world is continuous and can be described so, the control, if not hardware, is more often discrete. 

* If the process is linear, use the Laplace domain (s) for the control design then switch back to discrete time (z domain) for the actual control.
* You can use the laplace domain for the control itself if you are using analogic electronics.

Nowadays, the actual control is achieved on a digital controllers. PLCs, Microcontrollers, Single Board computers, computers.

**Pros:**

* High speed
* Can be cheap 

**Cons:**

* Works with numbers
* Need discretisation
* Approximation of the differential equation by difference equations

The control performance can usually be increased by increasing the sample frequency and increasing the resolution (reducing the LSB). Both increase the price. Yet, a good design consider the sampling effect and therefore can be used with lower frequency. 

Remember that your output is also a Zero Order Hold (steps).
