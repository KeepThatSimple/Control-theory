Control System
=================

[Add the control system image]

The following will be consideing **r[k]** the discrete consign, **y[k]** the discrete measure input and **x[k]** the discrete action on the system.

To realize a control design as good as possible, we have two ways.

* We can increase the control frequency so the ZOH (Zero Order Hold filter) output differs little from the aimed continuous signal.
  * **Cost** and **realisability** limits this approach.

* Develop digital design techniques in discrete time k (z domain) and implement the resulting controller as represented by difference equations.
  * Need a good description of the relation between x[k] and y[k]. This is influenced by the process, the sample period, the A/D and D/A conversions and the measure model.
  * The goal is to reduce costs by decreasing the sampling rate 
  * Minification of the inter-sample behavior
